I recently developed an interactive IPL Analytics Dashboard designed to give a complete, season-wise breakdown of team and player performance in the Indian Premier League. The idea was to create a dynamic dashboard where anyone could pick a season from the slicer and instantly view all the major highlights, making the analysis super smooth and user-friendly.

When a year is selected, the entire dashboard automatically updates to show the Champion and Runner-up teams, giving a quick snapshot of which team dominated that particular season. Along with this, the dashboard displays essential match insights such as the total number of sixes, fours, centuries, half-centuries, matches played, and venues used in that season. These metrics help users understand how competitive and action-packed each year of the tournament was.

I also included detailed player performance highlights by showcasing the Orange Cap (highest run-scorer) and the Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker) for each season. These sections make it easy to identify standout performers and compare their stats across different seasons.

Another major component of the project is the Points Table, which presents team rankings based on wins, losses, net run rate, and overall consistency throughout the tournament. This table helps analyze which teams performed steadily and which ones struggled over the course of the season.

To build this dashboard, I used Power BI for data visualization, creating measures, adding slicers, and designing an interactive layout. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, visual storytelling, and presenting sports data in a clean and engaging manner. It also improved my understanding of DAX, data modeling, and performance-focused dashboard desig
